# Iris Flower Classification Project

## Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Leveraging the dataset provided by Scikit-learn, which comprises measurements of iris flowers' sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, we aim to develop a predictive model for accurate species classification.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 150 samples, each representing an iris flower. For each sample, the following measurements are included:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

Furthermore, each sample is tagged with the corresponding iris species.

## Approach
1. *Data Exploration*: Gain insights into the dataset's structure and characteristics.
2. *Data Preprocessing*: Handle missing values, scale features, and encode categorical variables as needed.
3. *Model Selection*: Experiment with various classification algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines.
4. *Model Training*: Train multiple models using the training data and evaluate their performance using suitable metrics.
5. *Model Evaluation*: Assess the models' performance on the test dataset to identify the most effective one.
6. *Model Deployment*: Deploy the selected model to classify iris flowers based on their measurements effectively.

## Usage
